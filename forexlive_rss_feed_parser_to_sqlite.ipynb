An average of 4.14% over the next two years might work out to 3.75-4.00% in Fed funds, with the usual added premium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That idea makes intuitive sense if the Fed shifts to a strategy of keeping rates moderately high for longer, as the market senses that +5% won&apos;t last for long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, that all depends on how the economy weathers the latest banking turmoil and what happens to consumer and lending psychology in the aftermath. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the market is pricing in a 78.9% chance of a 25 bps hike tomorrow with the remainder set on &apos;no change&apos;. If the market gives the Fed permission to hike 25 bps (without too much hiking and screaming), then the FOMC can wait until May 3 to signal if the hiking cycle is over or needs to continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What turned the market?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statements from the European Banking Authority and the Bank of England that Additional Tier One products would rank higher than equity stemmed the selling there and that tightened CDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The EU/UK clarity was a very good move and net net probably helps the European economy longer-term as to permanently increase the cost of bank capital would be counterproductive,&quot; writes Deutsche Bank&apos;s Jim Reid today. &quot;As we&apos;ve shown for the last few days, CS was massively decoupled from the rest of the European banking sector in CDS terms over the last several months, so whilst harder times are to come economically, this announcement and the prior fairly stable European banking system outside of CS, should cut off contagion risks.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over on the US side, shares of First Republic are up 28% in the pre-market and that will be an important barometer today.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

A more stable financial environment in both Europe and the US has contributed to the Euro&apos;s strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The KRE regional bank ETF is trading at $45.08, an increase from yesterday&apos;s closing price of $43.56. First Republic shares are currently trading at $14.43, up from the closing level of $12.18; however, the share price did experience a significant 47% drop yesterday. Credit Suisse shares remain stable, while UBS shares are trading higher at $19.83, up from $18.80 at yesterday&apos;s close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European bond yields have also risen, with the German 10-year yield increasing by 17.4 basis points. US bond yields are following a similar upward trend. The US Dollar (USD) is showing mixed performance as markets await the Federal Reserve meeting scheduled for tomorrow at 2 PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/terms/f/federal-reserve/&quot; class=&quot;terms__main-term&quot; id=&quot;0139b451-c49a-48a1-8365-838a83595a97&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Federal Reserve&lt;/a&gt; is expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points, although some analysts, such as those from Goldman, Moody&apos;s Analytics, and Wells Fargo, predict no change in policy. The current interest rate stands at 4.75%. Uncertainty also surrounds the dot plot, or the expected terminal rate, which was 5.1% in December. The range for 2023 was estimated to be between 4.9% and 5.6%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important to remember that the Fed targets a range of 25 basis points; thus, a reading of 5.1% actually corresponds to a range of 5.0% – 5.25%. If &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/terms/t/the-fed/&quot; class=&quot;terms__secondary-term&quot; id=&quot;b7354d20-f768-47c3-9948-779afee14e9f&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the Fed&lt;/a&gt; raises rates by 25 basis points, it would bring the interest rate to 5.0%. Taking cues from the European Central Bank (ECB), the Federal Reserve may emphasize a data-dependent approach moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions still remain: Will 5% be the terminal rate? Will the Fed announce a conditional pause to allow the market to stabilize? Or will they continue with their current trajectory until there are clear signs of lower inflation levels or further slowdown in employment growth?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve will also release central tendency estimates for key economic indicators, including PCE inflation, unemployment, and GDP. These projections will provide insight into the Fed&apos;s expectations for year-end figures, which were as follows in December: headline PCE inflation at 3.1%, core PCE inflation at 3.5%, unemployment at 4.6%, and GDP growth at 0.5%. The central tendency estimates from December will serve as a reference point for understanding the Fed&apos;s outlook on the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A snapshot of the market currently shows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spot gold is trading down $12.84 -0.65% at $1965.63&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spot silver is trading down seven cents -0.33% at $22.45&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crude oil is trading at $68.54.

Markets are finally able to exhale with a bit more comfort as we see equities jump higher alongside bond yields in European trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;2-year German bond yields are up 24 bps to 2.56% and even closed the opening gap lower from yesterday. Meanwhile, 2-year Treasury yields are up some 21 bps at the moment to 4.13% as safety bets are pared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In the equities space, European indices are now seen up around 1.5% to 1.8% mostly with Spain and Italy the outperformers, up by over 2% on the day. Meanwhile, US futures were flattish early on from Asia but have now turned higher by nearly 1% ahead of the cash open later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;With the jump in bond yields and better risk mood, the Japanese yen and gold are two notable laggards today. USD/JPY is up by 100 pips to 132.30 levels even as the dollar trades more mixed on the session. Meanwhile, gold is continuing to back further away from a test of $2,000 yesterday and is now holding around $1,966 - down 0.6%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The euro and franc are seeing some decent gains as European investors are also relaxing after the Credit Suisse concern. Then, we have the antipodeans which are struggling after the RBA minutes earlier revealed that policymakers had already been looking to head to the sidelines even before the whole banking turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;AUD/USD is down 0.5% to 0.6680 but has inadvertently dragged the kiwi lower as well with NZD/USD down 0.8% to just below 0.6200.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

That despite the fact that the events in the US and Europe are not expected to have much repercussions on the Australian financial system, at least based on what we have seen so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In any case, markets are responding in due kind and OIS pricing now suggests roughly 96% odds that the RBA will indeed pause any rate hikes come 4 April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;I would argue that this is perhaps the reason why the aussie is struggling today, despite the better risk environment. In turn, that has inadvertently dragged the kiwi lower as well. Taking a look at AUD/USD:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;The pair has been rubbing against some short-term resistance around 0.6717-24 but looks to be finally coming back down today with a bit more conviction. That said, buyers are still in it for now as they are putting up a defense at the 100-hour moving average (red line) as also seen in trading yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;Hold above that and the near-term bias stays more bullish but break below and the bias turns more neutral instead, with the 200-hour moving average (blue line) seen nearby at 0.6655 currently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;text-align-justify&quot;&gt;In the bigger picture, the recent lows around 0.6565-80 will be the trigger point for any further downside momentum while the 100 and 200-day moving averages around the region of 0.6761-82 will need to be breached to establish the next potential upside leg.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

It is the first time that the global financial industry leader steps outside the realm of trading and investing, in an effort to support the development of the young community of Cyprus, where the company is headquartered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of a long-term corporate social responsibility (CSR) pro bono initiative, the company proposes to empower and direct youth towards health and well-being by sponsoring sporting events and other similar activities aimed at helping local communities to develop and foster healthy habits in the younger generation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked, “Why a Karate team?” Tajinder Virk, Co-founder and CEO of Finvasia Group, the financial conglomerate owning Fxview, said: “ We value the community we set foot in. The past five years have been excellent for us, so we thought it was about time we gave something back to our community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Youngsters need role models and by sponsoring the National Karate Team, we aim to instill pride, honor, self-confidence, self-awareness and discipline. These are all values that Karate as a martial art cultivates. It is more than a sport. It is a philosophy, which hopefully will be embraced by young sport lovers. We are proud to offer the Senior National Karate Team our support and we wish them every success, strength and stamina to bring gold home.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sporting event will bring over 500 Karate sportsmen and women from 48 European countries who will be battling for the title and for gold. Apart from crowning the best karatekas in Europe, the Guadalajara tournament also serves as a launching pad for the best teams to compete at the upcoming edition of the European Games held in Poland. So, the result of the competition will be decisive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following a series of successes at the European Karate Championships U21 (open to athletes under 21), where Cypriot male and female karatekas won gold, silver and bronze medals, the Cyprus National Team is now preparing for the approaching tournament in Spain. Here they will face defending champions such as Serap Ozcelik Arapoglu and Eray Şamdan of Turkey, Anzhelika Terliuga of Ukraine, and other stars of the impressive martial art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fxview aims to offer support to Cypriot sportsmen and women and give them the opportunity to enter Europe’s and the world’s sport elites.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

            "Description: pThe impacts of artificial intelligence on society and politics are getting more attention but the macroeconomic impacts are just scratching the surface./ppGoldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius write that generative AI, despite its uncertain potential, has shown remarkable progress in creating content similar to human-generated output and improving human-machine communication. He highlights the potential for  significant impacts on the labor force./pp“Despite significant uncertainty around the potential of generative AI, its ability to generate content that is indistinguishable from human-created output and to break down communication barriers between humans and machines reflects a major advancement with potentially large macroeconomic effects … We find that roughly two-thirds of US occupations are exposed to some degree of automation by AI, and that of those occupations which are exposed, most have a significant — but partial — share of their workload (25-50 per cent) that can be replaced … We estimate that one-fourth of current work tasks could be automated by AI in the US, with particularly high exposures in administrative (46 per cent) and legal (44 per cent) professions and low exposures in physically-intensive professions such as construction (6 per cent) and maintenance./p\n",

            "&lt;p&gt;Gold prices briefly traded above $2000 on Monday but quickly turned around and closed below the key level before falling back to $1935.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However the continued turmoil in banks and the belief that the Federal Reserve will have to cut rates this year has given another lift to gold. It&apos;s up $28 today to $1998 in what would be the highest close in a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $2000 level has proven to be problematic for gold in the past as it closed above it last March for one day early in the Ukraine war before reversing and falling to $1625 by September. In the big picture, this is the third big test of $2000 this cycle and the old technical saying goes that if you keep on knocking, eventually they let you in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seasonally though, gold is at an ebb and that argues for some caution. At the same time, there&apos;s mounting evidence that sovereigns are buying gold in what could be an unstoppable force. The growing alliance between Russia, China and the middle eastern states is an argument for all of them to ditch US dollar reserves in favor of precious metals. A premature central bank pivot would also raise questions about the willingness to fight inflation and that would be a powerful signal for gold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, I don&apos;t see the risk-reward proposition for gold longs but its resilience this week on days where banking fears had calmed is encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

            "&lt;p&gt;USD/CAD has pared today&apos;s decline to 38 pips and 1.3688 after falling as low as 1.3631.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 50 pip bounce comes as sentiment deteriorates and oil prices turn lower once again. At the start of the session, we warned that the space to watch was US regional banks and the KRE ETF that represents them. That turned lower about two hours ago and it&apos;s slowly sucked risk trades down with it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It remains at a session low, down 2% with eyes on embattled bank First Republic, which is down 6%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question here is whether banks need more help to shore up deposits and/or deposit flight. The Fed and ECB&apos;s actions in the past week indicated some bravado regarding bank flight and yesterday Yellen indicated the Treasury wouldn&apos;t take any steps to halt deposit flight. The question was more technical than the headline indicated -- the Treasury alone doesn&apos;t have the power to take that unilateral action without Congress -- but perception is reality in a bank run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gross warned that a recession is coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tech continues to outperform but some of that is long-duration and AI so I wouldn&apos;t take it as a big positive signal for the broader economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for USD/CAD, I think some of the risks around Canadian housing are fading for now with yields falling but risks around global growth are rising. Canadian oil will be an interesting spot for the next decade but with spot prices at $70, investment activity will slow and Canada&apos;s trade balance will worsen.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

            "&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-start&quot;&gt;The USDJPY found support buyers in the Asian session as it reached a low swing area (see green numbered circles) between 130.345 and 130.60, resulting in a reversal to the upside at the start of the North American session (refer to the earlier video HERE). The price then entered a higher swing area ranging from 131.550 to 131.84 (indicated by red numbered circles), encountering resistance from the falling 100-hour moving average within that zone. Sellers, leaning against this area, have since pushed the USDJPY back towards the lows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-start&quot;&gt;A breach below 130.345 could trigger further downside momentum, influenced by declining yields. The two-year yield has dropped by 9.3 basis points to 3.889%, while the 10-year yield has decreased by around five basis points to 3.450%. Observing the broader perspective on the four-hour chart, this week&apos;s swing area can be traced back to January and February. If the price falls below this level, traders would next target the February 10th low at 129.79.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

            "&lt;p&gt;The USDCAD reached a new low today, dating back to March 7th, dipping to 1.3630 and surpassing Tuesday&apos;s low of 1.3642. However, the currency pair has since reversed course, moving back into a key swing area between 1.3651 and 1.3665 (indicated by red numbered circles). Notably, the 50% retracement level of the rise from the February 20th low also lies at 1.3651.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traders are now closely watching the 1.3665 resistance level as a determinant of the market&apos;s direction. If this level holds resistance, and the price moves back below the 50% retracement at 1.3651, we may witness an acceleration in downward momentum. The next crucial target is 1.36014, a level that holds dual significance - it resides just above the natural support at 1.3600 and corresponds to the 61.8% retracement of the increase from the February 20th low.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

            "&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin&apos;s price reached a new session high today at $28,818, inching closer to yesterday&apos;s peak of $28,936. The digital currency is now trading at its highest level since June 11, 2022. Additionally, the price has been oscillating around the 38.2% retracement level, calculated from the March 2022 high ($48,234) to the November low ($15,479), which stands at $27,991.41.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For traders, this retracement level serves as a crucial short-term risk gauge. A sustained price above this level signals a more bullish outlook. Although the price has fluctuated above and below this level over the past five trading days amid consolidation, yesterday&apos;s corrective low managed to remain above the March 14 spike swing high of $26,533, reinforcing a bullish bias. Yesterday&apos;s low reached $26,688.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $26,533 level now represents a more conservative risk-defining threshold for buyers seeking further upside momentum. On the other hand, surpassing yesterday&apos;s high of $28,936 would shift traders&apos; focus towards the psychologically significant $30,000 level. Bitcoin has not traded above $30,000 since June 10, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FOMO bitcoin traders unite.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

            "&lt;p&gt;Today, earlier in the session, the EURUSD reached a new high, pushing into a topside swing area on the 4-hour chart above, ranging between 1.0926 and 1.0939. The peak price of 1.09292 attracted sellers looking to capitalize on profits in this risk-defining zone. Following this, the downward movement saw sellers driving the price into a lower swing area between 1.0866 and 1.08869, which has historical significance dating back to mid-January and early February (see red numbered circles in the chart above).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although price action between the January ceiling (red numbered circles 1-5) and the early February floor (red numbered circles 6-9) was notably choppy, the support level was expected/hoped (?) to hold today (see earlier video &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forexlive.com/technical-analysis/the-day-after-what-are-the-technicals-in-the-eurusd-usdjpy-and-gbpusd-saying-now-20230323/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;follow&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;). Additionally, the 38.2% retracement of this week&apos;s upward trend is near this level (at 1.08629), reinforcing its importance moving forward. As long as the price remains above 1.08629, buyers maintain control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price move higher off that support, has now also surpassed the high of the swing area at 1.08869, indicating increased buying momentum. On the upside, the upper swing area between 1.0926 and 1.09391 remains a resistance target for further bullish momentum. A break above this level would push the price towards 2023&apos;s extremes; the high price reached 1.10323 on February 2. Surpassing 1.0939 would open the door for traders to contemplate returning to that peak level.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

            "&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the S&amp;amp;P Index experienced a steep drop leading into the closing bell, ultimately closing near the day&apos;s low. Interestingly, this low price was just above the 200-day moving average (green line in the chart above, currently at 3933.59), making today a critical day for the index. Market participants wondered whether the price would dip below the 200-day moving average or make a recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the open, the major indices moved higher, with the S&amp;amp;P Index gapping up to 3959.21. This shift brought the price above the 38.2% retracement level of the decline from the February 2 high at 3956.53. Today&apos;s opening price, which also marked the day&apos;s low so far, played a crucial role. Additionally, the 100-day moving average (at 3961.33) was in close proximity to the 38.2% retracement level, and buyers promptly pushed the price above this level shortly after the open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These technical levels now serve as a solid foundation for support and a gauge for market bias going forward. As long as the price remains above these levels, buyers maintain control in the short term. Traders seeking further upside may use this area as a stop-loss level. The price is currently trading near the day&apos;s high at 3984.91 (high of 3987.33). The next critical target on the daily chart is the natural resistance at 4000, closely followed by the 50% midpoint of the same decline from the February high at 4002.15. Breaking through both levels would signal even greater control for the buyers.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

            "&lt;p&gt;The AUDUSD has experienced significant fluctuations since the FOMC rate decision yesterday, as seen on the hourly chart. Initially, the price surged past the resistance zone between 0.67239 and 0.67296, driven by the rate decision. However, as the price neared the crucial 200-day moving average (currently at 0.6760), sellers stepped in to push the price back down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the downside, the price broke below both the aforementioned swing area and a lower swing area between 0.6691 and 0.6703. It also breached the 100-hour moving average (blue line, currently at 0.6690), but the decline halted just before the 200-hour moving average (green line, currently at 0.66776) during today&apos;s early Asian session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buyers once again drove the price upward, nearing the 200-day moving average where sellers reemerged in the European session. The price retested the 100-hour moving average and the swing area between 0.6691 and 0.6703, resulting in a modest bounce to 0.67124. Evidently, the market has seen multiple up-and-down movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a distinct trading pattern has emerged, with resistance sellers appearing near the 200-day moving average (currently at 0.6760) and support buyers emerging close to the 100-hour moving average at 0.6690 and the 200-hour moving average of 0.66776. The intermediate swing area between 0.6724 and 0.6730 serves as a barometer, indicating bullish sentiment above and bearish sentiment below.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

The move came after solid initial jobless claims and current account data in a sign that the US economy is solid. I wouldn&apos;t have expected large-scale layoffs in the aftermath of the banking spat but some people might have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I the bigger picture, the UK pension episode looms large. It cost Liz Truss her career but certainly didn&apos;t derail the economy and we might be seeing some repositioning in the US dollar on the idea that the Fed will indeed hold rates higher for longer. US 2-year yields fell as low as 3.87% today but are back to 3.95%. Compared that to the Fed year-end dot at 5.00-5.25% and you have a fight on your hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

            "&lt;p&gt;The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. At its meeting ending on 22 March 2023, the MPC voted by a majority of 7–2 to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25%. Two members preferred to maintain Bank Rate at 4%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global growth is expected to be stronger than projected in the February Monetary Policy Report, and core consumer price inflation in advanced economies has remained elevated. Wholesale gas futures and oil prices have fallen materially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been large and volatile moves in global financial markets, in particular since the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and in the run-up to UBS’s purchase of Credit Suisse, and reflecting market concerns about the possible broader impact of these events. Overall, government bond yields are broadly unchanged and risky asset prices are somewhat lower than at the time of the Committee’s previous meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee (FPC) has briefed the MPC about recent global banking sector developments. The FPC judges that the UK banking system maintains robust capital and strong liquidity positions, and is well placed to continue supporting the economy in a wide range of economic scenarios, including in a period of higher interest rates. The FPC’s assessment is that the UK banking system remains resilient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting these developments, bank wholesale funding costs have risen in the United Kingdom and other advanced economies. The MPC will continue to monitor closely any effects on the credit conditions faced by households and businesses, and hence the impact on the macroeconomic and inflation outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional fiscal support was announced in the Spring Budget. Bank staff have provisionally estimated that this could, relative to the February Report, increase the level of GDP by around 0.3% over coming years. A full assessment, including the extent to which these measures could affect supply as well as demand in the medium term, will be conducted ahead of the May Monetary Policy Report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GDP is still likely to have been broadly flat around the turn of the year, but is now expected to increase slightly in the second quarter, compared with the 0.4% decline anticipated in the February Report. As the Government’s Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) will be maintained at £2,500 for three further months from April, real household disposable income could remain broadly flat in the near term, rather than falling significantly. The labour market has remained tight, while the news since the MPC’s previous meeting points to stronger-than-expected employment growth in 2023 Q2 and a flat rather than rising unemployment rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twelve-month CPI inflation fell from 10.5% in December to 10.1% in January but then rose to 10.4% in February, 0.6 percentage points higher than expected in the February Report. As a consequence, the exchange of open letters between the Governor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer is being published alongside this monetary policy announcement. Services CPI inflation was 6.6% in February, 0.1 percentage points weaker than expected at the time of the February Report, but food and core goods price inflation have been significantly stronger than projected. Most of the surprising strength in the core goods component was accounted for by higher clothing and footwear prices, which tend to be volatile and could therefore prove less persistent. Annual private sector regular earnings growth has eased, to 7% in the three months to January, 0.1 percentage points below the expectation in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPI inflation is still expected to fall significantly in 2023 Q2, to a lower rate than anticipated in the February Report. This lower-than-expected rate is largely due to the near-term news in the Budget including on the EPG, alongside the falls in wholesale energy prices. Services CPI inflation is expected to remain broadly unchanged in the near term, but wage growth is likely to fall back somewhat more quickly than projected in the February Report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MPC’s remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognises that there will be occasions when inflation will depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. The economy has been subject to a sequence of very large and overlapping shocks. Monetary policy will ensure that, as the adjustment to these shocks continues, CPI inflation will return to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. Monetary policy is also acting to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations are anchored at the 2% target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Committee has voted to increase Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25%, at this meeting. CPI inflation increased unexpectedly in the latest release, but it remains likely to fall sharply over the rest of the year. Services inflation has been broadly in line with expectations. The labour market has remained tight, and the near-term paths of GDP and employment are likely to be somewhat stronger than expected previously. Although nominal wage growth has been weaker than expected, cost and price pressures have remained elevated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extent to which domestic inflationary pressures ease will depend on the evolution of the economy, including the impact of the significant increases in Bank Rate so far. Uncertainties around the financial and economic outlook have risen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MPC will continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures, including the tightness of labour market conditions and the behaviour of wage growth and services inflation. If there were to be evidence of more persistent pressures, then further tightening in monetary policy would be required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MPC will make a full assessment of all of the news since the February Report, including the economic implications of recent financial market and banking sector developments, as part of its forthcoming May forecast round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MPC will adjust Bank Rate as necessary to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in line with its remit.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
